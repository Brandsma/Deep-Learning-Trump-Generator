Hence my use of Social Media, the only way to get the truth out. Much of Mainstream Meadia has become a joke! @foxandfriendsThe reason I originally endorsed Luther Strange (and his numbers went up mightily), is that I said Roy Moore will not be able to win the General Election.  I was right! Roy worked hard but the deck was stacked against him!Congratulations to Doug Jones on a hard fought victory. The write-in votes played a very big factor, but a win is a win. The people of Alabama are great, and the Republicans will have another shot at this seat in a very short period of time. It never ends!Consumer Confidence is at an All-Time High, along with a Record High Stock Market. Unemployment is at a 17 year low. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! Working to pass MASSIVE TAX CUTS (looking good).The people of Alabama will do the right thing.

Roy Moore will always vote with us. VOTE ROY MOORE!Lightweight Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, a total flunky for Chuck Schumer and someone who would come to my office “begging” for campaign contributions not so long ago (and would do anything for them), is now in the ring fighting against Trump.

I never watch Don Lemon, who I once called the “dumbest man on television!” Bad Reporting.Very little discussion of all the purposely false and defamatory stories put out this week by the Fake News Media. They are out of control - correct reporting means nothing to them. Major lies written, then forced to be withdrawn after they are exposed...a stain on America!Getting closer and closer on the Tax Cut Bill. Shaping up even better than projected.

I will cut Regs but make penalties severe when caught cheating!LAST thing the Make America Great Again Agenda needs is a Liberal Democrat in Senate where we have so little margin for victory already. The Pelosi/Schumer Puppet Jones would vote against us 100% of the time. He’s bad on Crime, Life, Border, Vets, Guns &amp, Military.

Look at your 401-k’s since Election. Highest Stock Market EVER! Jobs are roaring back!Democrats refusal to give even one vote for massive Tax Cuts is why we need Republican Roy Moore to win in Alabama.

No justice!So General Flynn lies to the FBI and his life is destroyed, while Crooked Hillary Clinton, on that now famous FBI holiday “interrogation” with no swearing in and no recording, lies many times...and nothing happens to her? Rigged system, or just a double standard?I had to fire General Flynn because he lied to the Vice President and the FBI. He has pled guilty to those lies.

The Bill is getting better and better. This is a once in a generation chance. Obstructionist Dems trying to block because they think it is too good and will not be given the credit!The jury was not told the killer of Kate was a 7 time felon.

His exoneration is a complete travesty of justice. BUILD THE WALL!A disgraceful verdict in the Kate Steinle case! No wonder the people of our Country are so angry with Illegal Immigration.The Dow just broke 24,000 for the first time (another all-time Record). If the Dems had won the Presidential Election, the Market would be down 50% from these levels and Consumer Confidence, which is also at an all-time high, would be “low and glum!”Stock Market hits new Record High.
